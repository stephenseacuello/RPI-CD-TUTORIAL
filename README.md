# Continuous Integration and Deployment on Raspberry Pi

A tutorial on continuous integration and deployment on a Raspberry Pi machine.  
This tutorial aims to connect the dots to create a successful CI/CD pipeline for an application.  
In this tutorial, we're building a minimal Flask application which can be deployed to our Raspberry Pi machine with just a push to a GitHub repository.

## Pre-requisites

- **A GitHub repository**  
  Host your source code here and use GitHub Actions to push the code to the Raspberry Pi.

- **Raspberry Pi setup**  
  Ensure your Raspberry Pi is configured so you can connect to it using SSH from a development machine.

- **A stable internet connection**  
  (Which I'm sure you have, since you're reading this page.)
